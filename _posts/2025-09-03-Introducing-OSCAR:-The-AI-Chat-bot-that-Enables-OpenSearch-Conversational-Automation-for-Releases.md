## Background & Motivation


OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite, performing as a platform for website search, log analytics, and application monitoring. It is powered through the OpenSearch core engine, OpenSearch Dashboards for visualization, and a suite of plugin applications which solve different end-user use cases.

The OpenSearch project is a community driven initiative, announced in January 2021 and adopted by the Linux Foundation since September 2024. This initiative oversees the open governance, collaboration, innovation, and development for the entire OpenSearch ecosystem, including OpenSearch core and OpenSearch Dashboards.

With exponential growth in its community contributions, particularly since joining the Linux Foundation, the OpenSearch project has also evolved its build and release infrastructure. This growth includes expanding from 120+ to over **170 repositories** and seeing active contributors surge from 1,000+ to over **3,500**.
This expansion, which has pushed total downloads beyond **1.1 billion**, has created a sophisticated ecosystem with multiple components, extensive testing requirements, and complex release orchestration. The OpenSearch Engineering Effectiveness (OSEE) team is responsible for driving the OpenSearch releases through the community while resolving the engineering issues, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies that arise across the project.

 Traditionally, the release process has relied heavily on manual intervention from engineers, resulting in time-consuming cycles where release managers must navigate numerous workflows, interpret complex metrics data, and coordinate communications across multiple stakeholders in Slack channels. 

This approach is inefficient and presented several challenges:

* **High Barrier to Entry**: New release managers require extensive onboarding and deep system knowledge
* **Manual Processes**: Repetitive tasks consume valuable engineering time
* **Knowledge Gaps**: Critical release information scattered across different systems and team members
* **Community Participation**: External contributors struggle to participate in release management due to complexity

By eliminating this tedious manual work, we're making OpenSearch release process truly accessible to everyone. This means whether you're a seasoned engineer or a new community member, you can contribute to the project release without domain specific knowledge. It's about opening doors and making collaboration easier for all.

## Why AI is the Solution

Modern AI capabilities, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational interfaces, offer a transformative approach to these challenges. AI can serve as an intelligent bridge between complex systems and human maintainers, contributors and infrastructure engineers, translating natural language requests into precise technical operations while maintaining security and audit trails.

This trend is already evident within the OpenSearch project, where features like neural search, machine learning **** framework, and OpenSearchâ€™s own Model Context Protocol (MCP) server have transformed data interaction and task automation from traditional methods. Inspired by these successes, the Engineering Effectiveness team recognized that similar technology could help solve the release bottlenecks and improve our own workflow processes.

Creating an autonomous agent that serves as the single source of truth (and interaction) for release contributors can largely reduce the manual context switching overhead for all participants. Through leveraging AI, access to sophisticated release management capabilities will be democratized, reducing workload on engineers and creating a more inclusive environment for community contributors.

## Introducing OSCAR

OSCAR (**O**pen**S**earch **C**onversational **A**utomation for **R**eleases) is a multi-agent powered AI Chatbot that is designed to democratize the OpenSearch release process by providing intelligent assistance, domain-specific knowledge retrieval, metrics & performance information, workflow automation, and general contextual support to the OpenSearch community.
Aiming for the ultimate goal of end-to-end release orchestration, OSCAR serves as the bridge by connecting multiple release tasks through a general conversational interface, reducing repetitive work, sharing knowledge and SOPs, summarizing detailed metrics into simple reports, and making it easier for external contributors to act as community release managers. 

Built on AWS Bedrock Agents with a dual-supervisor agent architecture, OSCAR serves as the central hub connecting multiple release tasks through a conversational interface. The system combines multiple feature sets, namely metrics analysis, knowledge base queries, Jenkins automation, and cross-channel communication, to provide comprehensive, context-aware responses.


### Architectural Overview

OSCAR's architecture implements a dual-agent security model where privileged users access full system capabilities while standard users receive read-only assistance, ensuring both accessibility and security.

### Component Flow for a Release Workflow - Jenkins Query

## OSCAR in Action: 3.2.0 Release Success Stories

During the OpenSearch 3.2.0 release, we launched a beta version of OSCAR internally, and demonstrated its value across three critical areas:

### 1. Metrics Integration and Analysis

![Metrics Integ Test Example Image](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-09-03-Introducing-OSCAR:-The-AI-Chat-bot-that-Enables-OpenSearch-Conversational-Automation-for-Releases/integ_test_ex.png)
![Metrics Integ Test Components Example Image](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-09-03-Introducing-OSCAR:-The-AI-Chat-bot-that-Enables-OpenSearch-Conversational-Automation-for-Releases/integ_test_coverage_ex.png)
OSCAR transformed how release managers interact with complex build and test data. Instead of manually querying multiple OpenSearch clusters and interpreting raw data, release managers could simply ask:

***Example Query**: "@OSCAR-beta Show me integration test results for RC 6 on version 3.2.0 for OpenSearch Dashboards"*

OSCAR's metrics system will automatically:

* Query OpenSearch metrics cluster for integration test related data
* Apply de-duplication to remove duplicate test results
* Cross-referenced Release Candidate (RC) numbers with specific artifact build numbers
* Generated comprehensive summary reports highlighting critical issues

**Technical Implementation**: The metrics system uses specialized Bedrock agents (Integration Test Agent, Build Metrics Agent, Release Metrics Agent) that process data from production OpenSearch clusters, ensuring release managers receive accurate, real-time insights without manual data processing.


### 2. Workflow Automation with Jenkins Integration

![Docker Scan Example Image](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-09-03-Introducing-OSCAR:-The-AI-Chat-bot-that-Enables-OpenSearch-Conversational-Automation-for-Releases/docker_scan_ex.png)
OSCAR triggers Jenkins workflow execution by natural language with built-in security controls.

***Example Command**: "@OSCAR-beta Run central release promotion workflow on Jenkins with 3.2.0"*

OSCAR's Jenkins workflow automation:

* Automatically resolved version "3.2.0" to specific RC and build numbers
* Pre-filled complex workflow parameters using historical data
* Implemented mandatory confirmation workflows for security measure
* Provided direct links to job execution and progress monitoring

**Security Features**: All Jenkins operations require explicit user confirmation and are restricted to authorized users through the dual-agent architecture. Every operation includes audit trails with user context for complete accountability.

### 3. Release Communication Automation

![Communication Orchestration Example Image](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-09-03-Introducing-OSCAR:-The-AI-Chat-bot-that-Enables-OpenSearch-Conversational-Automation-for-Releases/communication_automation_ex.png)
OSCAR streamlined release communications by automating message generation and multi-channel broadcasting.

**Capabilities Demonstrated**:

* **Automated Announcements**: Generated release announcements using predefined templates combined with real-time metrics data
* **Integration Test Summaries**: Created formatted reports of test results for stakeholder communication
* **Cross-Channel Coordination**: Broadcast messages to multiple Slack channels with consistent formatting
* **Automated Pinging**: Ping maintainers automatically via searching for maintainers through metrics queries

## Development Insights & What we Learned

OSCAR's development was relatively smooth, building a layered, secure modular architecture, but involved key refactoring as we discovered the complexity of release automation.

**Architectural Evolution**: We started with a simple LLM + knowledge base model but quickly realized release management required orchestrating multiple complex systems. This drove us to refactor toward an agentic approach with specialized collaborators for Jenkins, metrics analysis, and communications.

**Security-First Design**: Our dual-agent architecture (privileged vs. limited access) with mandatory confirmation workflows proved essential for enterprise adoption. Implementing security controls from day one avoided costly retrofitting later.

**Modular Infrastructure**: Using AWS CDK with separate stacks enabled rapid iteration on individual components. The serverless Lambda architecture automatically handled scaling during release periods, while DynamoDB's TTL features managed conversation context without manual cleanup.

**Real-World Complexity**: The 3.2.0 release revealed gaps between assumptions and actual needs. Users required intelligent deduplication, automatic parameter resolution, and context-aware formatting â†’ driving sophisticated query routing and specialized response logic.

The key insight: successful AI automation for enterprise workflows requires not just intelligent responses, but intelligent orchestration of multiple systems with robust security and deep understanding of operational complexity.

## Future Enhancements

OSCAR's roadmap focuses on transforming from a reactive assistant into a proactive, intelligent platform that anticipates issues and automates complex decisions:

### Predictive Intelligence & Proactive Automation
